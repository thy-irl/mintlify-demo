## Enhance testing efficiency

Katalon Studio offers unique testing capabilities to help you optimize your testing process:

* Combine multiple application types (Web UI, API, Mobile & Desktop) in one project and execution flow. You can test this capability using our [GitHub sample projects](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples).

* You can create tests by simply interacting with your application using Recorder and Spy. Then, edit your test case using interchangeable interfaces between manual and script editors.

* Reduce your test maintenance efforts with [self-healing](/katalon-studio/maintain-tests/self-healing-tests-in-katalon-studio), [Smart Wait function](/katalon-studio/record-and-spy/webui-record-and-spy-utilities/smart-wait-function), and [Time Capsule](/katalon-studio/maintain-tests/fix-broken-web-test-objects-with-time-capsule-in-katalon-studio).

* Utilize the built-in keywords and reusable custom keywords in test creating.

* Leverage a built-in AI-powered assistant that explains code snippet and generates code from natural language prompts. Learn more at [StudioAssist in Katalon Studio](/katalon-studio/create-test-cases/studioassist-in-katalon-studio).

## Comprehensive test coverage

Katalon Studio helps you achieve comprehensive test coverage:

* Gain a full understanding of your AUT with multiple supported testing types: data-driven testing, BDD testing, and keyword-driven testing.

* Cover different testing goals and scenarios by grouping test cases into test suites and test suite collections.

* Run tests across different environments with [TestCloud](#).

## Streamlined integrations

You can incorporate Katalon Studio with various tools for enhanced teamwork and productivity:

* Gain insights on test executions with Katalon Platform's analytics.
