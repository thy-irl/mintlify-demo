TestCloud addresses the following problems:

* Difficulty and inability to test across browsers and OS.
* Scalability issues due to cost and time constraint in setting up physical labs.
* Time-consuming configuration and integration for testing in different operating systems or scenarios.
* Limited availability of test scenarios/devices/OS/browsers.

**No setup and maintenance are required** to use TestCloud as your test environment. TestCloud is also ready to integrate with your CI/CD pipelines.

Katalon TestCloud is integrated with Katalon TestOps and Katalon Studio. For more information, see [Enable TestCloud integration in Katalon Studio](/katalon-testcloud/integrations/enable-testcloud-integration-in-katalon-studio).
