<Update label="Beta - October 25, 2023">
The following features and improvements are included in the latest release of Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta). Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) and earlier releases remain to be available only for selected Katalon users.

### New features

* All Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) test cases are now automatically saved to [Katalon Cloud](#).

  * You can access your Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) test cases from anywhere and is not limited to a specific browser.

  * Your progress in each Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) test case is saved automatically, so you can focus on updating them without losing your work.

  * This also means that the latest version of Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) has phased out the workflow step of "saving" your new test case as a [draft test case](/katalon-platform/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio-beta/create-and-manage-a-test-case/create-a-blank-test-case#concept-8633) as they are automatically "published" to the cloud.

* Introduced a new feature called Instant Run. Use Instant Run to quickly execute individual Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) test cases on Katalon Cloud and access analytics reports without the need to create a test suite. See the following topic for more information: [Instantly run a test case in Katalon Cloud](/katalon-platform/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio-beta/execute-katalon-cloud-studio-beta-tests/instantly-run-a-test-case-in-katalon-cloud).

### Enhancements

* Added the following supported actions. For more information, see [Supported actions](/katalon-platform/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio-beta/create-and-manage-a-test-case/supported-actions):

  * [verifyNumberLessThan](/katalon-platform/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio-beta/create-and-manage-a-test-case/supported-actions#topic-6956)

* The latest version of Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) has made UI improvements by moving the **+ Test Case** button on the main and side navigation so you can create test cases directly from the **Tests** tab, with the AUT launching automatically for quicker recording of test steps. This improvement reduces the time it takes for you to start recording a test case.

* The latest version of Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) has improved the Editor UI. Now you can quickly execute tests or add them to test suites within the Editor, allowing for quicker navigation and improved productivity.

* Users can no longer create, store, and modify Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) test cases and test suites in Git repositories. However, if Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) test cases and test suites in Git repositories were previously made, you can still view and execute your test cases and test suites on the Katalon TestOps.

### Bugs fixed

* The issue with the Open Browser keyword causing errors when running tests with TestCloud has been resolved.

* Some users report sync issues and/or encounter duplicate test cases across browsers. With all Katalon Cloud Studio (Beta) test cases now saved on the Katalon Cloud, users can experience seamless test case management and improved reliability.
