<Accordion title="How does the data flow within Katalon systems?">
Customer data is exclusively used on Katalon TestOps, including Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE), Katalon Studio, Katalon TestCloud, and Katalon TestOps, with no other purposes.

Customer data remains active as long as the account is active. Upon voluntary closure, the data enters an "expired" state, and is subsequently transferred to "cold storage" and retained for 365 days. After this duration, both the account and its associated data are permanently removed from our systems.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What personally identification information (PII) does Katalon retain?">
Katalon retains personal identification information (PII) for user license verification, including name, email, and IP address.

We retain PII solely for the purpose of processing license payments; we do not process or manipulate the data in any other way or for any other purposes.

<Accordion title="How is user data stored? What encryption is used for data at rest and data in transit?">
* Data is stored in approved data stores within AWS. Structured data is stored in databases while unstructured data is stored in securely configured AWS S3 buckets.

* Data at rest is encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption, while data transit is encrypted with TLS 1.2+ (RSA 2048-bit) encryption. Approved secure channels include SSH, HTTPS, and SFTP.

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Do you have an enforced password policy for administrator accounts? Do you require MFA for administrator accounts?">

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can unprotected user data be accessed by your staff? Is this access audited?">
Our internal staff is prohibited from directly accessing user data. Only approved database administrators, upon request from the data owner, are granted access to assist them directly.

All access is meticulously logged and subject to regular audits for accountability and security.
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Is there a separation between publicly accessible parts of the application from the data storage?">
Yes. Public-facing components are housed in separate logical networks behind load balancers.

Architecture design follows an n-tier pattern with all data decoupled from external-facing application components.

There is no direct external access to data stores.
