## Requirements

* You have a Katalon account. You can create an account from [the Katalon website.](https://katalon.com/)

* You have created a Katalon Project. See: [Create an Account and Organization](/katalon-platform/administer/administration-tasks/create-an-account-and-organization).

* You have connected a Git repository for your project. See: [Configure a Git repository in TestOps](/katalon-platform/organize/configure-a-git-repository-in-testops).

## Plan tests

As a QA manager, you must provide detailed test plans that outline the approach, objectives, scope, resources, schedule, and procedures for testing a software application.

TestOps facilitates test planning by allowing you to create releases and builds. Inside a release or a build, you can link all the testing requirements and check for release readiness or requirement coverage.

TestOps also supports integration with Jira. You can link test runs in TestOps with Jira requirements. See: [Enable TestOps - Jira integration for test management](/katalon-platform/integrations/jira-integration/enable-testops---jira-integration-for-test-management).

<Info>
**Note:**

* If you have not created and executed any test runs, refer to this guide: [Quick guide for testers](/katalon-studio/get-started/quick-guide-for-testers).

</Info>
To create a release and link a test run, follow these steps:

1. In TestOps, go to Planning. In the Releases tab, click Create Release.

</Frame>

2. In the Create Release section, fill in the release information:

   * Name: the release version (e.g., release 8.0.0).
   * Start Date: when you want to start your release time frame.
   * Release Date: when your release ends.

3. Click Create.

Result: You have now created a release.

Once Jira integration is enabled, you can:

* Populate Jira releases. See: [Populate Jira releases](/katalon-platform/integrations/jira-integration/populate-jira-releases)

* Link test cases to Jira requirements. See: [Link test cases to Jira requirements](/katalon-platform/integrations/jira-integration/link-test-cases-to-jira-requirements)

After creating a release, you can link test runs to a release. See: [Link test runs to a release in TestOps](/katalon-platform/plan/link-test-runs-to-a-release-in-testops)

The Planning > Releases tab as shown in the image below allows you to view and analyze test releases and its readiness after linking your test runs to Jira releases.

</Frame>

The Planning > Requirements tab organizes your Jira requirements linked to your test cases. This tab also allows you to access and view test case coverage and traceability matrix reports.

</Frame>

If you have enabled BDD configuration in Katalon TestOps, you can also quickly check BDD test results in the Requirement tab. See: [View BDD test results in TestOps](/katalon-platform/analyze/reports/view-test-reports/view-bdd-test-results-in-testops)

## Organize your test cases

Here is a quick guide for QA managers on how to organize test cases in Katalon TestOps.

In Katalon TestOps, you first need to upload your test scripts using Git repositories to Katalon TestOps. This allows you to manage version control and synchronization in the Katalon TestOps. See: [Configure a Git repository in TestOps](/katalon-platform/organize/configure-a-git-repository-in-testops).

After uploading your test scripts from the Git repository, you can organize your tests in test suites or dynamic test suites.

* To manage your tests in Katalon TestOps, see: [Manage test suites in Katalon TestOps](/katalon-platform/organize/manage-tests-in-testops/manage-test-suites-in-katalon-testops)

* To manage your tests in Katalon Studio, see the following topics:

  * [Manage test suites in Katalon Studio](/katalon-studio/manage-test-artifacts/manage-test-suites-in-katalon-studio)

  * [Manage dynamic test suites in Katalon Studio](/katalon-studio/manage-test-artifacts/dynamic-test-suite/manage-dynamic-test-suites-in-katalon-studio)

If you want to run parallel tests with multiple browsers, you can add and manage your test suites in a test suite collection. See: [Manage test suite collections in Katalon Studio](/katalon-studio/manage-test-artifacts/manage-test-suite-collections-in-katalon-studio).

## Analyze your test reports

Here is a quick guide for QA managers on how to view and understand test reports in Katalon TestOps.

Katalon TestOps provides several ways to gain a clear view of the overall readiness of your projects.

As part of your daily tasks, you will refer to the test reports to evaluate your testing progress. Go to your Project > Reports on the Katalon TestOps dashboard to view your test reports.

To learn more about test reports, see: [Reports overview](/katalon-platform/analyze/reports/reports-overview).

The test reports most referred to by Katalon users are:

| Report                 | What does it do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
